[CS214: System Programming] (https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/course/systems-programming) in Rutgers is an unergraduate class focusing on the basic concepts in linux and unix-like operation system. These are all the notes and code for class CS214 when I was TA for this calss at 2017 Fall.

I think this class is quite practical not only for the review of the rudimentary knowledge of operation system but also for the intern interview. 

Compared with the operation system, this class is more focusing on prgramming, In my opinion, the projects when I was a TA are really heavy for students. There are three project , first one is using merge sort to sort a files containing many column, this project aims to train the ability for string parsing by c/c++, second one is updating the first one into a multiprocess version, every process in charge of a sorting task in spedific direactory, the third project is based on the second one and update it into a multiprocess version. The final project requires students to build a client-server based on socket using their own protocol to send the rpc to server and get the mergerd results.

Even though the projects are really heavy , some students could still do an excellent job for all the projects and exam, frankly speaking, even though those concepts are really rudimentary and improtant, not every CSer know them well. I think it's better to sort all the materials here and review them frequently.

 - the folder demo contains all the class demo to show the basic concepts and using traps 
 - the folder notes contains the ppt and notes on recitation to show the meaning of all the concepts. 
 - the project contains all the grading scripts, part of scripts come from other TA.


I put **all the reference** here for this class notes.
